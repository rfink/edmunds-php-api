    "body": "<p>The 2013 Toyota Camry is offered in L, LE, SE and XLE trim  levels. The L features 16-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, power windows  and mirrors, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  split-folding rear seats, a trip computer, Bluetooth, a 6-inch display and a  six-speaker sound system with a CD player, HD radio, satellite radio, an auxiliary  input and a USB/iPod interface.</p>\n<p>The Camry LE adds automatic headlamps, power door locks with  remote keyless entry, audio controls on the steering wheel and an outside  temperature display.</p>\n<p>The SE includes a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy  wheels, foglamps, heated exterior mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, sport  seats and unique interior and exterior styling treatments. SE V6 models get  18-inch wheels, keyless ignition/entry, a navigation system, voice recognition  and the Entune smartphone and Web integration system.</p>\n<p>The luxurious XLE reverts to the LE's softer suspension  settings and adds heated exterior mirrors, foglamps, a sunroof, dual-zone  automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver seat and the Entune system.  XLE V6 models add a rearview camera, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather  upholstery, a power front passenger seat and heated front seats.</p>\n<p>Some of the extra features found on the higher trims can be  added as options to the lower trim levels, though availability can vary  depending on which region of the country you live in. A premium 10-speaker JBL  audio system is optional for the SE and XLE. On the XLE V6, Toyota also offers  a hard-drive-based navigation system with a larger central display.</p>",
    "interior": "<p>The interior of the 2013 Camry feels roomy and its thin front  pillars provide good outward visibility. What the cabin design lacks in cohesiveness,  it makes up for with generally good materials quality, especially the handsome  stitching on the dash and door panels of upper trims. The spacious rear seat is  complemented by a nicely reclined seatback angle that helps the Camry match the  Honda Accord for the most comfortable backseat in the class.</p>\n<p>The Camry's upgraded audio system also includes Entune, a  suite of smartphone-connected services that includes features like the Bing  search engine, Pandora streaming radio, real-time traffic, sports and stock  information, and the ability to reserve movie tickets or a table at a  restaurant on the go. The touchscreen interface and accompanying steering wheel  controls are usually pretty easy to use, but sometimes the virtual buttons'  unwillingness to respond is frustrating.</p>\n<p>At 15.4 cubic feet, the Camry's trunk capacity is about  average, although the 60/40-split rear seat folds down to yield more cargo space  when necessary.</p>",

    "metaDescription": "With its long-standing history of dependability, the 2013 Camry stands as one of the top choices in the highly competitive midsize sedan segment.",
    "driving": "<p>Both four-cylinder and V6 engines generate ample power for  their sizes, and that power is delivered in a smooth, quiet fashion. Gearchanges  are likewise unobtrusive, and for a car that earns such high fuel economy  numbers, the transmission surprises with quick downshifts when additional power  is needed. On the highway, the 2013 Toyota Camry is comfortable and an  excellent long-distance companion.</p>\n<p>The electric-assisted steering feels pretty good in the V6  and SE versions. But non-SE four-cylinder versions are vague and somewhat  lifeless in comparison. Most drivers will probably be fine with the way the  Camry drives, but we still recommend the SE. It's not exactly sporty, but does  feel more in line with the handling and responsiveness of its best rivals.</p>",
    "whatsNew": "<p>For 2013, the Toyota Camry receives rear cross-traffic alert functionality as part of the optional blind spot monitoring system. Inside, all Camry models have the 6-inch central display screen as standard and slightly upgraded door panel trim.</p>",

    "powertrain": "<p>Every 2013 Toyota Camry features front-wheel drive, a  six-speed automatic transmission and two engine choices.</p>\n<p>Base Camrys are powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that  produces 178 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque. In Edmunds performance  testing, a Camry LE with this engine accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 8.4  seconds, about average for a four-cylinder midsize sedan. With EPA-estimated  fuel economy of 25 mpg city/35 highway and 28 combined, the four-cylinder Camry  is among the class leaders.</p>\n<p>Optional is a 3.5-liter V6 that generates 268 hp and 248  lb-ft of torque, which helps the Camry V6 reach 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, average  for upgrade engines in this class. Fuel economy is an impressive 21/31/25.</p>",

    "safety": "<p>The 2013 Toyota Camry comes with a battery of standard safety  features, including antilock brakes, stability control, front- and rear-seat  side airbags, side curtain airbags and knee airbags for both driver and  passenger. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert is also  available.</p>\n<p>In Edmunds braking tests, a Camry LE stopped from 60 mph in  129 feet, a bit longer than average for the segment. An SE V6, with stickier  tires, performed the same test in 119 feet, which is better than average. </p>\n<p>In government crash testing, the Camry received a top  five-star score for overall crash protection, with four stars for overall  frontal protection and five stars for overall side protection. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety gave the Camry the best possible rating of &quot;Good&quot;  in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. It scored a &quot;Poor&quot;  (the worst rating) in that agency's new, &quot;small overlap&quot; frontal  impact crash test, but only a handful of cars have been subjected to it, and  most have earned a similar score.</p>",

    "introduction": "<p>After saddling the last generation of its best-selling sedan  with a disappointing interior and dull personality, <a href=\"/toyota/\">Toyota</a>  got with it and redesigned the Camry  last year. The newest Camry continues the model's long-standing record of  reliability and low running costs and adds an improved interior, more  expressive styling and, especially in SE trim, livelier driving. The 2013  Toyota Camry gets further polish with a few more standard features and upgraded  interior materials.</p>\n<p>As before, the Camry powertrain lineup deserves kudos for its  combination of peppy performance and admirable fuel economy. Even the four-cylinder  engine provides pleasing acceleration, while the potent V6 manages an  impressive 25 mpg in combined driving. Those seeking a fuel sipper can choose the  Camry Hybrid, covered in a separate review. Although the Camry offers  respectable handling and a comfortable ride, the driving experience still feels  rather disconnected and numb. The SE trim provides sharper, more involved handling  that doesn't exactly transform the Camry into a sport sedan, but offers more  appeal to those who enjoy driving. </p>\n<p>Naturally, there are other appealing midsize sedans out this  year. The <a href=\"/honda/accord/2013/\">2013 Honda Accord</a> and <a href=\"/nissan/altima/2013/\">2013 Nissan Altima</a>  continue to offer slightly sportier personalities to enhance their practicality.  The <a href=\"/hyundai/sonata/2013/\">2013 Hyundai Sonata</a> offers comparable refinement and stellar value. The new Ford Fusion is another  favorite of ours thanks to well-rounded performance and* Connection #0 to host api.edmunds.com left intact sharp styling. We think  most people will be very pleased with a 2013 Toyota Camry purchase, but with so  many great choices, we suggest planning a weekend's worth of test-drives.</p>",
